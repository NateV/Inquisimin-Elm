{- This module provides methods for making interviews really, really quickly at the cost of 
    input validation. This module provides helpers for making interviews that store state in a dictionary. You can only ask one question per step of the interview, and the values are all stored as text.

    Note that for this to work, every `Question a` in the interview has to have the same `a` type. 
    This is why DictModel cannot do any validation or store any values other than `String` values in the interview's state. Every Question has too be a `Question String`.

{-| Helps check which branch of a branching path to go down.

  Check if a value has been collected with the key `key`. Then if that value is validly parsed by 
  the reader function (if only we could infer instances of Read, amiright?), return the value wrapped in a Maybe type. Or return Nothing, to indictate the interview still needs to collect the information about which branch to go down.
